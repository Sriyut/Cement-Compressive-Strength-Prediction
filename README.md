# Cement-Compressive-Strength-Prediction
This project is for predicting the compressive strength (What is the pressure that one metric cube of that particular concrete block can handle) of a cement block based on quantities of differnt
material. So with the help of this model we can predect that based on the load what should be mixture that we need to use.
